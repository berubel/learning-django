What is an API?

Application Programming Interface

Application == An actual app, it's something that is functional
Programming == We're programming it
Interface = something that allows two thing to communicate to each other

So the way that you allow these processes to comunicate is by programming an application that allowa them 
to then send and receive messages.

Why use / build an API?

If:
* you have some sort of application that you'd like to share with other 
* you'd like other people to integrate with and use in their services
* you just have multiple services that need to communicate with one central service.

One point about API's: That it only provides the data that you want to render
That data tipically return a JSON response, that means it's a kind of like dictionary
and it has keys and values, and that payload.

** IMPORTANT **

An API only returning you the data and because API is only send and receive data
that's what allowa you to integrate with multiple services, because that's all you
really care about is getting the data or submitting data to that service.
